On June 9, 2023, I had the opportunity to deliver an oral presentation at the 15th World Congress of Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization (WCSMO-15) held in Cork, Ireland. The presentation focused on my research titled "Projected Variable Three-Term Conjugate Gradient Algorithm to Improve the Generalization Performance of Neural Network Training." It was an honor to share my work at such a prestigious event!
